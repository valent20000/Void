Void
====

A Visual Novel about murder, sadness, and the eternal fight against good and bad. He may become private. We'll see later !

It will actually use SFGUI, SFML, and TinyXML2. I'm currently alone on the project, so i'm making everything.
But i'm planning to get an Artist to help tho !

Well, hope you'll enjoy the demo version that i'll release !

PS : There might be obvious reference to other piece of art, hope you'll see them.

At first you feel inapprehensive. Then you feel angry, and sad. And all your emotions burst into a total chaos.
But then he come. The void. You can't feel him, because when he is here, you do not feel anymore.

But if you don't feel, what will you do ?
